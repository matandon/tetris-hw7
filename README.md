Tetris

About the Development: This was an assignment I completed for CMU's 15-112 course, which I self-taught.

Controls: Use the right arrow to move right, the left arrow to move left, the down arrow to move a row down, and the up arrow to rotate the piece. Use the spacebar to immediately set your piece on the grid (hard drop).
